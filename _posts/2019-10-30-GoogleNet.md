## 1. Introduction

**GoogLeNet**, introduced in 2014 by Szegedy et al. in the paper *“Going Deeper with Convolutions”*, was the **winning model of ILSVRC 2014** (ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge). It marked a leap forward in convolutional network design by introducing the **Inception module**, which allowed the network to go "deeper" and "wider" without significantly increasing computational cost.

It achieved a **Top-5 error rate of 6.67%**, beating architectures like VGGNet and showcasing efficient utilization of compute.

## 2. Historical Context

- Deep learning was gaining momentum after **AlexNet (2012)** and **ZFNet (2013)**.  
- VGGNet in 2014 demonstrated performance through **depth and simplicity**.  
- However, **very deep networks** led to:  
  - Overfitting  
  - High memory/computation cost  

**GoogLeNet’s innovation** was in **efficient deepening** of networks using a modular, multi-path design — the **Inception module**.

---

## 3. Motivation Behind Inception Architecture

The paper was driven by the question:

> “What is the optimal local sparse structure in a convolutional vision network, and how can it be approximated efficiently?”

Key motivations:  
- Use **multiple filter sizes** at the same layer to capture features at different scales.  
- Keep computational complexity **constant or lower**.  
- Replace naive stacking of layers with **carefully designed modules**.  

---

## 4. GoogLeNet Architecture Overview

- Total depth: **22 layers (27 if pooling counted)**  
- Parameters: **~5 million** (much fewer than VGGNet’s 138M)  
- Core building block: the **Inception module**  
- Includes **auxiliary classifiers** to mitigate vanishing gradients  

### Architecture Highlights:
- Alternates between **Inception modules** and **MaxPooling**  
- Ends with **global average pooling** instead of fully connected layers  
- Includes **2 auxiliary classifiers** acting as regularizers and intermediate supervision

## 5. The Inception Module

Each Inception module consists of **parallel convolutional and pooling operations**:

| Path | Operation |
|------|-----------|
| 1    | 1×1 convolution |
| 2    | 1×1 → 3×3 convolution |
| 3    | 1×1 → 5×5 convolution |
| 4    | 3×3 max pooling → 1×1 convolution |

### Why 1×1 Convolutions?
- Used for **dimension reduction** (bottleneck layers)  
- Reduce number of input channels before expensive 3×3 or 5×5 filters  
- Add **non-linearity** and **depth**  

**→ Efficient deep feature extraction with low cost**
