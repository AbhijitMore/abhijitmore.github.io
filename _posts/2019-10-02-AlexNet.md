## 1. Introduction

In 2012, a seismic shift occurred in the field of computer vision. At the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge (ILSVRC), a deep neural network named **AlexNet** outperformed all other competitors by a significant margin. Created by **Alex Krizhevsky**, **Ilya Sutskever**, and **Geoffrey Hinton**, this deep convolutional neural network set new standards for accuracy, efficiency, and scalability, triggering a deep learning revolution.

## 2. The Landscape Before AlexNet

Before AlexNet, traditional computer vision relied heavily on handcrafted features (SIFT, HOG, etc.) combined with classical machine learning classifiers (SVMs, Random Forests). Deep learning models existed but were limited in performance due to:

* Lack of large datasets
* Limited computational resources
* Vanishing/exploding gradient issues in deep networks

The **ImageNet** dataset changed this by providing **over 1.2 million labeled images across 1000 categories**, offering the scale needed for training deep models.

## 3. Overview of AlexNet Architecture

AlexNet is a deep convolutional neural network designed to classify images into 1000 different classes. Inspired by **LeNet-5**, it was scaled massively to handle high-resolution input and deeper layers.

**High-Level Structure:**

* Input: RGB image of size **227x227x3**
* 5 Convolutional Layers
* 3 Fully Connected Layers
* ReLU Activations
* Dropout Regularization
* Max-Pooling
* Final Softmax Classifier

**Stats:** ~60 million parameters and ~650,000 neurons
