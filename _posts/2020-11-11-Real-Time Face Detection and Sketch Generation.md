# Introduction

This is a simple Flask application that streams video from a webcam while performing facial recognition using OpenCV's Haar Cascade Classifier. The application captures video frames, detects faces, and displays them on a web page in real-time.

## Getting Started

To get started with this facial recognition video streaming app, follow the instructions below.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- Flask
- OpenCV

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/FaceDetectionApp.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**

    ```bash
    cd FaceDetectionApp
    ```

3. **Install the required dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. **Run the Flask application:**

    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

2. **Open your web browser and go to [http://localhost:5000/](http://localhost:5000/) to access the facial recognition video streaming page.**

3. **Navigate to the `/video_feed` route to view the live video stream with facial recognition.**

## Customization

If you want to customize the application or integrate it with a different camera source, you can modify the following files:

- `app.py`: Main application file containing the Flask routes.
- `camera.py`: Module defining the `VideoCamera` class responsible for capturing video frames and performing facial recognition.

Feel free to explore and adapt the code to meet your specific facial recognition requirements.
