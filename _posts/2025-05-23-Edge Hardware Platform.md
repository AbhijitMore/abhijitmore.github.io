As AI models increasingly move from the cloud to the edge, choosing the right hardware platform becomes critical. Whether you're deploying object detection on a drone, gesture recognition in robotics, or speech recognition in smart devices, your choice of hardware can make or break the experience. Among the most popular platforms enabling this shift to **Edge AI** are **NVIDIA Jetson** and the **Raspberry Pi**. Let's unpack their architectures, capabilities, and core technical distinctions — no setup guides, just the raw, intuitive engineering details.

## 🔧 What is Edge AI?

Before we dig into the platforms, it's important to grasp what **Edge AI** implies:

> **Edge AI** refers to the deployment of AI models and inference at the edge of the network — close to the data source — rather than on centralized cloud servers.

**Benefits include:**

* **Low latency inference** - Processing data locally eliminates the round-trip time to cloud servers
* **Reduced bandwidth consumption** - Only essential data needs to be transmitted over networks
* **Improved data privacy** - Sensitive information remains on the device where it's collected
* **Real-time performance** - Critical for autonomous systems and time-sensitive applications

Edge AI requires hardware that's energy-efficient yet powerful enough to run deep learning inference tasks — and that's where Jetson and Raspberry Pi come into play.
