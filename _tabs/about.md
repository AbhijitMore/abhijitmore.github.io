Hello! I'm **Abhijit More**, a passionate **Software Engineer (AI/ML)** focused on creating innovative AI solutions that solve real-world problems. I specialize in leveraging deep learning, machine learning, and AI technologies to develop impactful products. 🤖💡

### What I Do

I am a Machine Learning Engineer at F-Secure, where I build production-grade AI systems that protect users from scams and digital threats at scale. My work focuses on designing, optimizing, and deploying reliable, high-performance ML models that operate under real-world constraints such as latency, robustness, and large-scale user impact.

Previously, I worked as a Software Engineer (AI/ML) at Sony India Software Centre, developing and deploying computer vision models on low-power, low-memory edge devices. I specialized in model optimization, compression, and inference efficiency, enabling image classification and object detection systems to run effectively in resource-constrained environments.

Before Sony, I was associated with IIT Madras Pravartak, where I strengthened my foundation in large language models and transformer architectures, contributing to multiple applied AI projects. Earlier in my career, I worked at HighRadius as an Associate Software Engineer, building AI-driven financial intelligence systems, including a predictive model for invoice payment timelines used in enterprise workflows.

### Passion for Innovation

I am inspired by AI’s transformative potential across industries—from healthcare to finance and beyond. With a strong focus on optimizing AI for real-world applications, I strive to create intelligent, efficient, and impactful solutions that drive progress. 

Always open to connecting and exploring how AI can address real-world challenges together. 🌍🚀
