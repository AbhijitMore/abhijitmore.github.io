# Work Experience

**Software Engineer – AI/ML**, *Sony India Software Centre, Bengaluru, Karnataka, Aug 2024 – Present*

* Partitioned DeepSeek and Phi-3 models by splitting transformer layers across memory-constrained Raspberry Pi and Jetson Nano for real-time inference; preserved **100%** accuracy without compromising architectural integrity.
* Deployed an AI-based image failure detection on Jetson Orin NX to detect defocus, off-centre framing, and exposure issues; achieved **82%** accuracy, cut drone reshoots by **40%**, and was adopted by **3+** U.S. energy clients.

**AI/ML Trainee**, *Sony Finishing School @ IITM Pravartak, Chennai, Tamil Nadu, Feb 2024 – Aug 2024*

* Led cross-functional development of a CNN-based murmur detection system using Mel-spectrograms from digital stethoscope data, achieving **86%** accuracy in early identification of pathological heart sounds for remote diagnosis.
* Built a quality-gating pipeline for scanned legal documents using Otsu’s thresholding and custom blur detection; flagged low-quality pages for enhancement, reducing OCR extraction errors by **20%** across 15K legal documents.
* Secured a full-time offer from Sony India post-program, as a top **1%** candidate based on performance and interview.

**Associate Software Engineer – I**, *HighRadius, Hyderabad, Telangana, Jul 2022 – May 2023*

* Developed a LightGBM-based payment date prediction model using customer behavioral trends and historical transactions; enabled proactive prioritization of delinquent accounts, improving overdue invoice recovery by **25%**.
* Engineered a CatBoost-based classification system to evaluate deduction validity across 600k+ financial transactions; isolated high-confidence invalid claims with **93%** accuracy, eliminating **73%** of manual follow-ups.

**Product Intern – Data Science**, *HighRadius, Bhubaneswar, Odisha, Aug 2021 – Jun 2022*

* Eliminated SQL bottlenecks in a high-throughput, asynchronous Java REST API powering ML-based payment prediction pipelines; reduced latency by **40%** using `CompletableFuture`, batched queries, and MySQL indexes.
* Crafted a scalable feature engineering pipeline leveraging Python (Pandas) and SQL to efficiently extract, transform, and aggregate critical variables from large transactional data, boosting ML model accuracy by **8%**.

# Projects

**[MediCompanion RAG Application](https://github.com/AbhijitMore/MediCompanion)**, *Sep 2024 – Oct 2024*

* Designed a domain-specific RAG chatbot using LangChain, Ollama, and LLaMA 3.2 (7B) to generate semantically grounded responses, achieving **87%** answer accuracy on a benchmark of 100 curated health and fitness queries.
* Optimized chunking and FAISS index to reach **92%** top-3 document retrieval accuracy on 50+ medical PDFs.
* Configured cloud-independent LLaMA 3.2 inference, achieving sub-**2s** latency on constrained healthcare systems.

**[YoloV1 Object Detection Implementation](https://github.com/AbhijitMore/yolov1)**, *Mar 2024 – Apr 2024*

* Constructed a YoloV1 object detection model optimized for real-time applications using PyTorch.
* Streamlined dataset handling and training workflows, enhancing model training and evaluation efficiency.
* Integrated MLflow for experiment tracking, metrics logging, and model performance visualization.
